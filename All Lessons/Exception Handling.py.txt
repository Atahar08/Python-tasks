The code defines a function emoji_converted that takes a message, splits it into words, and replaces certain words with emojis. It uses a dictionary to map words to emojis. The function is then called with user input, and the result is printed. The code demonstrates string manipulation, dictionary lookup, and emoji usage in Python, allowing users to input messages and see them converted to include emojis.


```python
def emoji_converted(message):
    separated_words = message.split()
    emoji = {
        "happy": "ðŸ˜Š",
        "sad": "ðŸ˜¢"
    }
    output = ""
    for word in separated_words:
        output += emoji.get(word, word) + " "
    return output

message = input("Type your message: ")
result = emoji_converted(message)
print(result)
```
