This Python code creates a 2D list (matrix) with three rows and columns. It demonstrates accessing specific elements, modifying values, and printing the matrix. Nested for loops are used to iterate over each element, printing each item individually. The code showcases basic operations on a 2D list, including creation, access, modification, and iteration, providing a foundation for working with matrices in Python.




```python
# Creating a 2D list (matrix)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Printing the 2D list
print(matrix)

# Accessing elements
print(matrix[0])  # First row
print(matrix[1])  # Second row
print(matrix[2])  # Third row
print(matrix[0][2])  # Element at row 0, column 2
print(matrix[1][1])  # Element at row 1, column 1

# Modifying a value
matrix[0][2] = 15
print(matrix)

# Using nested for loops to print each item
for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item)
