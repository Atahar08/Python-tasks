This Python code demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, integer division, modulus, exponentiation, and augmented assignment operators. It performs calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and showcases operator precedence. The code also uses augmented assignment operators to increment and decrement variables. The results of each operation are printed to the console, illustrating the output of various mathematical operations in Python.




# Basic arithmetic operations
print(5 - 3)       # Subtraction: 2
print(5 + 3)       # Addition: 8
print(5 * 3)       # Multiplication: 15
print(5 / 3)       # Division: 1.666...

# Integer division and modulus
print(5 // 3)      # Integer division: 1
print(5 % 3)       # Modulus: 2

# Exponentiation
print(5 ** 3)      # Exponentiation: 125

# Augmented assignment operators
x = 5
x += 5            # Increment x by 5
print(x)          # 10
x += 5            # Increment x by 5 again
print(x)          # 15

y = 5
y -= 2            # Decrement y by 2
print(y)          # 3

# Operator precedence
z = 5 + 3 * 2 ** 2
print(z)          # 17

p = (5 + 3) * 2 ** 2
print(p)          # 32
