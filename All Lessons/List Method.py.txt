The code demonstrates various list operations in Python. It creates a list, appends and inserts elements, removes and sorts elements, checks for element existence, counts occurrences, and finds an element's index. It also copies the list, pops the last element, and clears the list. The code showcases basic list manipulation techniques, such as adding, removing, and searching for elements, and modifying the list's structure.



```python
# Creating a list
number_list = [1, 2, 5, 1, 10, 14]
print(number_list)

# Appending an element
number_list.append(20)
print(number_list)

# Inserting an element at a specific index
number_list.insert(1, 7)
print(number_list)

# Removing a specific element
number_list.remove(2)
print(number_list)

# Sorting the list
number_list.sort()
print(number_list)

# Reversing the list
number_list.reverse()
print(number_list)

# Checking if an element is in the list
print(1 in number_list)
print(12 in number_list)

# Counting occurrences of an element
print(number_list.count(1))

# Finding the index of an element
print(number_list.index(10))

# Copying the list
number_list2 = number_list.copy()
print(number_list)
print(number_list2)

# Popping the last element
number_list.pop()
print(number_list)

# Clearing the list
number_list.clear()
print(number_list)
