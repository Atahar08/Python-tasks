The code prompts the user for their name and address, storing the input in name and address variables. It then prints out the user's name and address using string concatenation. The code uses input() to get user input and print() to display the output. This is a basic example of interacting with users and displaying personalized messages in Python




# Define variables
age = 30
print(age)  # Outputs: 30

age = 20
print(age)  # Outputs: 20

weight = 72.5
print(weight)  # Outputs: 72.5

name = "nourishman faraki"
print(name)  # Outputs: nourishman faraki

good_programmer = True
print(good_programmer)  # Outputs: True

good_programmer = False
print(good_programmer)  # Outputs: False
