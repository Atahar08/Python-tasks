The code defines and prints various variables: age (integer), weight (float), name (string), and good_programmer (boolean). It then reassigns values to age and good_programmer. The code also defines variables for a product: product_name, price, expiry_date, and discount_available, and prints their values. This demonstrates basic variable declaration, assignment, and printing in Python.




```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
print("While loop ended")
```
