The code creates a list of numbers and removes duplicates. It iterates through the original list, checking each number against the 'unique' list. If a number isn't in 'unique', it's appended. The result is a new list containing only unique numbers from the original list. This approach ensures that duplicate numbers are removed, leaving a list with distinct values. The output is a list of unique numbers: [1, 2, 5, 6, 10].




```python
number_list = [1, 2, 1, 5, 6, 10]
unique = []

for number in number_list:
    if number not in unique:
        unique.append(number)

print(unique)
```
