The code defines a parent class Laptop with a method parts() and a child class Desktop that inherits from Laptop. The Desktop class initially has no methods, but later an additional method weight() is added. Objects of both classes are created, and their methods are called, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding in Python. The code showcases how a child class can inherit and extend the behavior of a parent class.




```python
# Parent class
class Laptop:
    def parts(self):
        print("Keyboard, Display, Motherboard")

# Child class inheriting from Laptop
class Desktop(Laptop):
    pass

# Create objects and call methods
my_laptop = Laptop()
my_laptop.parts()  # Output: Keyboard, Display, Motherboard

my_desktop = Desktop()
my_desktop.parts()  # Output: Keyboard, Display, Motherboard

# Adding an additional method to the Desktop class
class Desktop(Laptop):
    def weight(self):
        print("Desktops are heavyweight")

# Create object and call the new method
my_desktop = Desktop()
my_desktop.parts()  # Output: Keyboard, Display, Motherboard
my_desktop.weight()  # Output: Desktops are heavyweight
