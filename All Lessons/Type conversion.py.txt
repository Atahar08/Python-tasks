The code defines a tuple number_tuple with three elements. It prints the tuple, accesses the element at index 1, and attempts to modify it (which raises a TypeError since tuples are immutable). The code also counts the occurrences of the number 2 and finds its index in the tuple, demonstrating basic tuple operations in Python, including indexing, counting, and indexing methods.




# Ask for temperature in Celsius
celsius = input("Enter temperature in Celsius: ")

# Convert Celsius from string to integer
celsius = int(celsius)
a
# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Print the result
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit:", fahrenheit)
