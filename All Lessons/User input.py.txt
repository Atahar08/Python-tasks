The code asks for the user's name and address, then prints them out. It uses the input() function to get user input and stores it in the name and address variables. The code then uses string concatenation to print out a message with the user's name and address. This is a simple example of user input and output in Python.




# Asking for the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Printing the user's name
print("Username: " + name)

# Asking for the user's address
address = input("Where are you from? ")

# Printing the user's name and address
print(name + " lives in " + address)
