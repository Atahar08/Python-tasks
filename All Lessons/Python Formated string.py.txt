The code demonstrates string concatenation and formatted strings in Python. It defines two variables, name and codename, and uses them to create a message. The first method uses the + operator to concatenate strings, while the second method uses an f-string to format the string. Both methods produce the same output: "nozeman parikey (nf) teaches ai".








# Using concatenation
name = "nozeman parikey"
codename = "nf"
message = name + " (" + codename + ") teaches ai"
print(message)

# Using formatted string
name = "nozeman parikey"
codename = "nf"
message_1 = f"{name} ({codename}) teaches ai"
print(message_1)
