lesson-10-if-statement.py: Demonstrates the use of if statements to control the flow of a program based on conditions.
lesson-11-logical-operators: Explains logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions in decision-making.
lesson-12-comparison-operator: Covers comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to compare values and expressions.
lesson-13-while-loop: Introduces while loops for executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
lesson-14-for-loop: Explains for loops to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, or strings.
lesson-15-nested-loops: Demonstrates the use of loops within loops to handle complex iteration scenarios.
lesson-16-lists: Covers the creation and manipulation of lists to store and manage collections of items.
lesson-17-2d-list: Introduces 2D lists (lists of lists) for representing matrix-like structures.
lesson-18-list-method: Explains various list methods (append, remove, sort, etc.) to perform operations on lists.
lesson-19-Unique: Shows how to identify and handle unique elements within a list.
lesson-20-tuple: Covers tuples, immutable sequences used to store collections of items.
